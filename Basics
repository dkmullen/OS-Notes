- Get-Help ls
- Get-Help ls -Full
- ls -Force (show hidden)
- pwd
- cd ..\Desktop = go up one, then to desktop

cat
cat <fliename> -Head 10 - first 10 lines (or -Tail)
more (pauses) - use ENTER to advance by line, SPACE by page
q to quit
start notepad++ <filename> to start from cli
Get-Alias ls (reveals the PowerShell command behind the alias) in this case, Get-Children) [PS only seems to use similar commands to bash/zsh/etc; but these are aliased native PS commands]
Windows search service indexes files on a schedule - often disabled on servers, and enabled for your home dir on a Pc (it's resource intensive) By default, you can search for name, path, last-modified, size etc, but not inside files.
Change this by Start, type 'indexing' click Indexing > Users > Advanced, Files Type tab -> Index Props -> File Contents
Then search via explorer (search at top)
NotePad ++ (open and use ctrl-shft-F) has good file search across files
sls - (Select-String) - search from command line
c:\'Program Files\' -Recurse -Filter *.exe - a more advanced search, for exe files in programs dir
echo woof > dog.txt - creates a file (dog.txt) which contains 'woof'
echo is alias for Write-Output
stdin stdout stderr - each process has these three streams - stdin is what I type (for example); stdout is shown on the screen or (as in the echo cmd above, saved to file via >, a redirector operator)
> overwrites, >> appends
| sends output of one command to input of another
cat words.txt | sls st - takes the content of words.txt (stdout of cat) and pipes them thru sls (Select-String), ie returns words that contain 'st'
cat words.txt | sls st > new_file.txt - save the above to new file
stdout (1) and stderr(2) are numbered, and if we want to redirect stderr (error messages) it would be cat words.txt | sls st 2> err_file.txt
Or throw away err messages with 2> $null
